# üì± Mobile Price Range Predictor

A complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the price range of mobile phones based on their specifications. The project uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a dataset of mobile phone features and is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a system that can accurately classify mobile phones into four price categories:

-   **0: Low Cost** (Under ‚Çπ10,000)
-   **1: Medium Cost** (‚Çπ10,000 - ‚Çπ20,000)
-   **2: High Cost** (‚Çπ20,000 - ‚Çπ40,000)
-   **3: Very High Cost** (Above ‚Çπ40,000)

This is achieved by training a machine learning model on key features like RAM, battery power, camera quality, and processing speed. The final model is then served through a user-friendly web interface.
